What needs to go into the <<<site.xml>>> file?

 I used the example <<<site.xml>>> file found at {{{https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html}Creating a site page}}.
 Then I edited the links (those will show up in the top right if I am correct) and changed the menu to what I needed/wanted.

 Since I did not know what reports were yet, I deleted that line.
