How to create content?

 As can be seen at {{{https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html}https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html}} we can put 
 all the content we create under

+--------+
scr/site/apt/

 Take a look at the repository to get a feel for what needs to be there.
 A quick guide for APT can be found at {{{https://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html}https://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html}}.
 Notice that I never used APT before this little project and in fact it is not that hard once you just dive into it.
